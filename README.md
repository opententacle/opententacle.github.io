# OpenTentacle

Static blog site for **OpenTentacle**: Markdown articles, contributor profiles, and client-side routing. Built with **Vite**, **Lit**, and **TypeScript**, deployed to **GitHub Pages**.

## Features

- **Blog index** — articles loaded recursively from `src/assets/articles/**/*.md`, sorted by `date` metadata (newest first).
- **Article pages** — Markdown rendered to HTML with metadata chips (date, author, AI-assisted when set); author can link to a contributor profile when it resolves.
- **Contributors** — profiles and social links in `src/data/contributors.ts`; dedicated route `/contributors` with optional hash anchors (`#contributor-id`).
- **SPA routing** — paths such as `/article/<slug>` and `/contributors` are handled in the browser; the dev server and production setup serve `index.html` for unknown paths so refreshes and deep links work.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (the CI workflow uses Node 24; any recent LTS should work)
- **npm**

## Scripts

| Command        | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`  | Start Vite dev server (HMR)                      |
| `npm run build`| Typecheck (`tsc`) and production build to `dist` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve `dist` locally                          |
| `npm run lint` | Run Biome                                        |
| `npm run fix`  | Biome with `--fix`                               |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

```

## Articles (Markdown)

1. Add a Markdown file anywhere under **`src/assets/articles/`**, e.g. `2026-05-04/post.md` (or `2026-05-04/index.md`). The **slug** is the markdown basename (`post`) or the folder name when using `index.md`.
2. Optional **blockquote front matter** at the very top (consecutive `> key: value` lines):

   | Key            | Purpose |
   | -------------- | ------- |
   | `date`         | Used for ordering (ISO-ish strings parse for sort). |
   | `author`       | Display string; can be a contributor **id** (e.g. `cs`) or full name matching `src/data/contributors.ts`. |
   | `author-id`    | Explicit contributor id if you want id + display text split. |
   | `ai-assisted`  | Shown in metadata when set. |

3. First `# heading` is the **title**. First `##` under it is the **catchline** on the blog card (if present).
4. Relative links/images inside markdown are resolved from that markdown file's folder, so article-local assets work, e.g. `![Chart](chart.png)` or `[PDF](files/report.pdf)`.

Example:

```markdown
> date: 2026-04-04
> author: cs

# My title
## Short subtitle for the card

Body starts here…
```

See **`example-article.md`** in the repo root for a minimal template (reference only; posts live under `src/assets/articles/`).

## Authors and contributors

- **`src/data/contributors.ts`** defines `ContributorProfile` entries (`id`, `name`, `bio`, optional `links` with kinds for icons).
- **`resolveContributorForArticle`** (used from `src/utils/article-meta.ts`) matches an article’s `author` / `author-id` to a profile. On the **article** page, a resolved author becomes a link to **`/contributors#<id>`** (scroll handled on the contributors page).

## Routing

- **`/`** — blog list.
- **`/article/<slug>`** — single post.
- **`/contributors`** — contributor list; **`/contributors#<id>`** scrolls to a card.

Navigation uses the History API (`pushState`); internal links use **`handleInternalNav`** so the app updates without full reloads.

### Base URL (`import.meta.env.BASE_URL`)

For **GitHub Pages project sites** (`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`), asset and route URLs must include the repo prefix. **`vite.config.js`** sets `base` from **`GITHUB_REPOSITORY`** in CI: user/org site repo `username.github.io` → `base: '/'`, otherwise `base: '/<repo>/'`. Local builds use `base: '/'` unless you set the env var yourself.

## GitHub Pages: why `404.html` equals `index.html`

GitHub Pages has no built-in knowledge of SPA routes. A request to `/article/foo` has no matching static file, so the server would 404. The build copies **`index.html` → `404.html`** so GitHub Pages can still deliver the app shell for those requests; the client router then reads `location.pathname` and renders the correct view.

The **dev** server uses a small middleware (`spa-dev-fallback`) to mirror the same behavior locally.

## Deployment

The workflow **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** runs on pushes to **`main`**: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, uploads **`dist`** to GitHub Pages. Ensure the repository’s **Pages** source is set to **GitHub Actions** (or your chosen source) in the repo settings.

## UI stack notes

- **Lit** custom elements use the **`ot-`** prefix (e.g. `ot-app`, `ot-blog`, `ot-article`).
- **Font Awesome** is imported once in `app.ts`. Components that need icon classes use **light DOM** (`createRenderRoot() { return this; }`) where global FA styles must apply.
- Markdown HTML is sanitized with **DOMPurify** before injection.
